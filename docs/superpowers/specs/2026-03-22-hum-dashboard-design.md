# hum-dashboard — Design Specification

## Overview

The operator's command centre. An internal dashboard for 1-2 people managing the entire fleet of clients. It is an exception-handler, not a task manager — if the operator spends significant time in it, the automation has a problem.

## Architecture

**Pattern:** Lean BFF — Next.js App Router with API routes importing hum-core repositories directly. No service layer, no separate API server. Single process, single deploy.

├── API Routes (import hum-core repos directly)
└── hum-core (workspace dependency — DB, repositories, types)
```

**Key decisions:**

1. **BFF over separate API** — API routes import hum-core directly. Simplest path, no network hops. The client portal will need its own BFF later; that's fine.
2. **System-level issues only** — "Issues" page replaces the full Escalation Queue. Scoped to failed posts, expired tokens, and content generation errors. Engagement-based escalations (reviews, DMs) deferred until hum-engagement is built.
3. **Env-var password auth** — Simple HTTP-only cookie auth. Operator enters password from `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` env var. No NextAuth.js, no OAuth for MVP.
4. **Media proxy route** — `/api/media/[...path]` streams generated images from local storage. Keeps file paths private, works regardless of storage location.
5. **React Query auto-polling** — `refetchInterval: 30000` on all queries. Dashboard feels alive without SSE complexity.
6. **Functional-first UX** — Standard click-based UI with shadcn/ui components. No keyboard shortcuts for MVP.

## Pages

### 1. Fleet Overview (`/`)

Landing page. Operator checks in, sees status, leaves.

**Layout:**
- **Status bar** — four large numbers: Active (green), Issues (amber), Onboarding (blue), Paused (grey). Derived from `clientRepo.list()` grouped by client status.
- **Two-column middle:**
  - Left: System Health — content pipeline status, social connection count, token health, generation failure count. Each line has a green/amber/red dot.
  - Right: Recent Issues — latest 2-3 problems with severity indicator and timestamp. Links to Issues page.
- **Upcoming content strip** — next 4 scheduled posts as thumbnail cards (client name, platform, time). Links to Content Preview.

**Data:** `clientRepo.list()`, `contentItemRepo.list()`, and per-client social account queries — aggregated in `/api/fleet/stats`. Note: `socialAccountRepo` currently only exposes `listByClientId()`, not a global `list()`. The fleet stats route iterates over clients to aggregate social account status. If this becomes a performance issue at scale, a `listAll()` method can be added to hum-core.

### 2. Clients List (`/clients`)

Searchable, filterable table of all clients.

**Layout:**
- **Search bar** — client-side filtering by name or email.
- **Status filter tabs** — All, Active, Issues, Onboarding, Paused (with counts).
- **Table columns:** Client (name + location + email), Plan tier, Connected Platforms (expired tokens struck through), Scheduled content count, Status badge.
- Clicking a row navigates to `/clients/[id]`.
- Paused clients visually dimmed.

**Data:** `clientRepo.list()` enriched with social account and content item counts. For MVP (<50 clients), fetch all and filter client-side.

### 3. Client Detail (`/clients/[id]`)

Everything about one client.

**Layout:**
- **Header bar** — client name, status badge, plan tier, contact info, "Pause Client" button.
- **Left column:**
  - Brand Profile — voice guide, key selling points, content themes (tags), hashtag strategy.
  - Connected Platforms — each social account with connection status and platform account ID.
- **Right column:**
  - Onboarding Progress — vertical step tracker (create client → process menu → generate brand profile → setup social accounts → trigger content generation). Only shown for clients in onboarding.
  - Recent Content — last 5 content items with thumbnail, caption preview, platform, status badge.

**Data:** `clientRepo.getById()`, `brandProfileRepo.getByClientId()`, `socialAccountRepo.list({ clientId })`, `contentItemRepo.list({ clientId, limit: 5 })`, `onboarding_sessions` table (by client_id).

### 4. Content Preview (`/content`)

Browse upcoming scheduled content across all clients.

**Layout:**
- **Filter bar** — dropdowns for client, platform, time range (24h / 7d / 30d). Total count displayed.
- **Timeline view** — posts grouped by date. Each post card shows:
  - Thumbnail (actual generated image via `/api/media/`)
  - Client name, platform badge, content type badge, scheduled time
  - Caption preview (truncated)
  - Actions: Preview (full modal), Pause (reverts to draft), Delete

**Preview modal:** Full-size image + complete caption + hashtags + CTA. Shown when "Preview" is clicked.

**Data:** `contentItemRepo.list({ status: 'scheduled', dateRange })` via `/api/content`.

### 5. Issues (`/issues`)

System-level problems requiring operator attention. Primary work surface for MVP.

**Layout:**
- **Filter tabs** — All, Failed Posts, Expired Tokens, Gen Errors (with counts).
- **Issue cards** — each card shows:
  - Severity-colored left border (red: expired token, amber: failed post / expiring token, purple: gen error)
  - Category badge, client name, description, timestamp
  - Contextual action buttons

**Issue types and actions:**

| Type | Border | Actions |
|------|--------|---------|
| Token Expired | Red | Reconnect, Pause Client, Dismiss |
| Token Expiring Soon | Amber | Refresh Token, Snooze 24h | *Deferred — requires `expiresAt` on SocialAccount* |
| Failed Post | Amber | Retry, View Posts, Dismiss |
| Content Gen Error | Purple | Retry, Skip Post, Dismiss |

**Data:** Aggregated from `contentItemRepo.list({ status: 'failed' })` and `socialAccountRepo` queries via `/api/issues`.

**Distinguishing failure types:** ContentItem's `status: 'failed'` does not differentiate between scheduling failures and generation failures. To distinguish them: if `mediaUrls` is empty (length 0), it's a generation error (media was never created); if `mediaUrls` has entries but `postedAt` is null and status is `failed`, it's a scheduling/posting failure. The `/api/issues` route applies this logic when categorizing.

**Retry mechanism:** "Retry" resets the content item's status from `failed` back to `draft` via `contentItemRepo.update()`. The content engine's scheduler picks up `draft` items on its next run and re-attempts generation or scheduling. The dashboard does not call pipeline code directly — it only resets state. For social account token issues, "Reconnect" is a placeholder link that navigates the operator to the platform's auth page (manual re-auth for MVP).

**Dismiss mechanism:** Since ContentItem and SocialAccount schemas don't have a `dismissedAt` column, dismissed issue IDs are tracked in a lightweight `dismissed_issues` table in hum-core: `{ id, entity_type ('content_item' | 'social_account'), entity_id, dismissed_at, snooze_until? }`. This avoids polluting the core models with dashboard-specific concerns. The `/api/issues` route excludes dismissed IDs from results. Note: `snooze_until` is included in the schema for forward-compatibility but is unused in MVP (the only snooze-able issue type, "Token Expiring Soon", is deferred). No snooze UI logic needed for MVP.

**Token expiry detection:** The SocialAccount model currently has no `expiresAt` field. For MVP, "Token Expiring Soon" is deferred — the Issues page only surfaces tokens that are already expired/disconnected (status field). Token expiry warnings will be added when the social account model gains an expiration timestamp.

## Shared Layout

Sidebar navigation with 4 items + auth controls:

- **hum** (logo/brand)
- Fleet Overview (`/`)
- Clients (`/clients`)
- Content (`/content`)
- Issues (`/issues`) — with badge showing active issue count, auto-polled every 30s
- Logout button at bottom

Sidebar is a server component. Issue badge is a client component with its own polling query.

## API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose | Data Source |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `POST /api/auth/login` | POST | Validate password, set HTTP-only cookie | env var |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | POST | Clear cookie | — |
| `GET /api/clients` | GET | List all clients with status | `clientRepo.list()` |
| `GET /api/clients/[id]` | GET | Single client + brand profile + socials + onboarding | Multiple repos |
| `PATCH /api/clients/[id]` | PATCH | Update client (pause/unpause) | `clientRepo.update()` |
| `GET /api/content` | GET | List content items (filterable) | `contentItemRepo.list()` |
| `PATCH /api/content/[id]` | PATCH | Update content item (pause → draft) | `contentItemRepo.update()` |
| `DELETE /api/content/[id]` | DELETE | Remove content item | `contentItemRepo.remove()` |
| `GET /api/issues` | GET | Aggregate failed content + expired tokens | `contentItemRepo` + `socialAccountRepo` |
| `POST /api/issues/[id]/retry` | POST | Reset failed content item status to `draft` for re-processing | `contentItemRepo.update()` |
| `POST /api/issues/[id]/dismiss` | POST | Mark issue acknowledged | `dismissed_issues` table |
| `GET /api/media/[...path]` | GET | Stream media file from local storage | `fs.createReadStream()` |
| `GET /api/fleet/stats` | GET | Aggregated counts for fleet overview | Multiple repos |

**Auth middleware** wraps all `/api/*` routes except `/api/auth/login`. Validates HTTP-only cookie. Returns 401 on failure.

## Data Flow

Every page follows the same pattern:

```
Page loads → React Query hook → GET /api/... → API route imports repo
→ repo queries SQLite → returns JSON → React Query caches → UI renders
                                         ↕
                             refetchInterval: 30000 (auto-poll)
```

**Mutations** use `useMutation` with strategy per action:
- **Pause content** — optimistic (flip status in cache, revert on error)
- **Delete content** — pessimistic (wait for confirmation)
- **Retry failed post** — pessimistic (show spinner, update on result)
- **Dismiss issue** — optimistic (remove from list immediately)

## Error Handling

- API routes return `{ error: string, code: string }` on failure
- React Query `isError` shows inline error banners per-section (no full-page errors)
- Auth failures (401) redirect to `/login`
- Media proxy returns 404 for missing files; UI shows placeholder image
- No global error boundary for MVP

## Dependencies

**Runtime:**
- `next` — framework
- `react`, `react-dom` — UI
- `@tanstack/react-query` — server state management
- `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` — styling
- shadcn/ui components (installed via CLI, not a package)
- `hum-core` (`workspace:*`) — database, repositories, types

**Dev:**
- `typescript`
- `@types/react`, `@types/node`
- `vitest` — testing

## Seed Data

A seed script populates hum-core with test data for development:
- 5-10 clients across all statuses (active, onboarding, paused)
- Brand profiles with realistic takeaway data
- Social accounts (some connected, some expired)
- Content items across all statuses (draft, scheduled, posted, failed)
- Onboarding sessions at various stages

This lets the dashboard be developed and demoed independently of the real pipelines.

## MVP Scope

**In scope:**
- Fleet Overview with status counts and system health
- Client list with search and status filters
- Client detail with brand profile, social accounts, onboarding progress, recent content
- Content preview with filters, media thumbnails, pause/delete actions
- Issues page with failed posts, expired tokens, gen errors, and contextual actions
- Env-var password auth with HTTP-only cookie
- Media proxy for generated images
- React Query auto-polling (30s)
- Seed data script

**Out of scope (deferred):**
- Engagement-based escalations (reviews, DMs, comments)
- Performance dashboard with charts
- Real-time SSE updates
- Ad campaign management
- Client health scoring
- Bulk actions
- Activity audit log
- Notification system (email/Slack)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- NextAuth.js / OAuth

## Dependencies on Other Packages

- **hum-core** — all database models and repositories (Client, BrandProfile, ContentItem, SocialAccount, onboarding_sessions). Also requires a new `dismissed_issues` table for the issues dismiss/snooze mechanism, and filter extensions on `contentItemRepo.list()` and a `listAll()` on `socialAccountRepo`.
- **hum-onboarding** — onboarding_sessions schema must be merged into hum-core before dashboard can show onboarding progress. If the onboarding branch is not yet merged when dashboard development begins, the onboarding progress component will be stubbed (show "Onboarding data unavailable" for clients with `status: 'onboarding'`) and wired up once the schema lands.
- **hum-content-engine** — content items and local media storage must follow the expected schema for the dashboard to display them. The `contentItemRepo.list()` method will need filter extensions: `limit`, `offset`, `dateRange` (before/after), `status` (single or array), and `clientId`. These are straightforward additions to hum-core.

## Depended On By

None. The dashboard is a leaf node — it consumes data, does not produce it.
